## Dev Guide

### Working with translations
For translations, i18n is used.

There are scripts in `dev-tools` folders which can be used to extract translations from the code and compare them with the translations in the `src/assets/i18n` folder.

To make sure the translations will be picked up by the script, use the `'` character instead of `"` or `` ` `` for the translation keys.
